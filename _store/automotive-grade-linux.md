name: Automotive Grade Linux
description: Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) is a collaborative open source project under the Linux Foundation that develops a unified software platform for connected vehicles. AGL brings together automakers (Toyota, Honda, Mercedes-Benz), suppliers, and technology companies to build an open Linux-based software stack for in-vehicle infotainment, instrument clusters, telematics, and software-defined vehicle (SoDeV) architectures. The platform decouples software from hardware enabling rapid automotive application development.

    name: AGL VSOMEIP Service API
    description: AGL uses SOME/IP (Scalable service-Oriented MiddlewarE over IP) via the vSomeIP library for vehicle service communication. This enables microservice communication between ECUs over Ethernet using the SOME/IP protocol, supporting service discovery, request-response, and event notification patterns for in-vehicle networks.
