description: CarAPI is a developer-friendly vehicle API and database that provides programmatic access to automotive data including makes, models, trims, bodies, engines, mileage, VIN decoding, license plate decoding, OBD-II diagnostic codes, and power sports vehicle information. The platform follows a freemium model - its public vehicle dataset is available without an account, and paid plans unlock higher daily request limits and production use. The API is REST/JSON with JWT authentication and ships with OpenAPI, Swagger, ReDoc, and Postman documentation.

    name: CarAPI Vehicle API
    description: The CarAPI Vehicle API provides REST/JSON access to a vehicle database covering year/make/model (1900-2026), sub-models, trims (1990-2026), bodies, engines, mileage, interior, and exterior attributes. Authentication uses JWT tokens obtained from /api/auth/login with an api_token and api_secret. The API supports pagination (up to 1000 per page), sorting, JSON filter queries with operators, and modified-since caching. Responses are available as application/json, application/ld+json, and application/hal+json. CORS is not supported; the API is intended for server-side integration.
